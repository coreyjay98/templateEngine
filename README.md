## Project Description

For this project I was tasked with forming the Javascript behind this template engine, I was given the HTML templates and had to create Javascript that worked with node and inquirer to take command line inputs and turn it into HTML.

### Installation

As this app is ran through node and the terminal, if you wanted to install it from GitHub you would need to install the inquirer package for node and run the app.js page through the terminal in node, this will give you the question list in the terminal that will then append to A HTML file located in the output folder

### Usage

Use of this application is simple as once you have it installed correctly you will be asked question in the command line and the answers will be directly printed to the HTML file, make sure your spelling is good!

### Technologies Used

Javascript, Node.js, NPM, NPM inquirer
